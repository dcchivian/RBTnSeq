parameters:
  input_read_library :
    ui-name : |
      Read Library Object
    short-hint : |
      Reads from pooled barcode mutants
    long-hint  : |
      The set of reads from the barcode mutant pool that you want to map to the input genome. Reads should be single end.
  input_genome :
    ui-name : |
      Genome object
    short-hint : |
      Genome to map barcode reads to
    long-hint  : |
      The genome of the organism that was subjected to transposon mutagenesis, that you want the reads mapped to.
  input_barcode_model :
    ui-name : |
      Barcode model
    short-hint : |
      Which barcode model was used to make the reads?
    long-hint  : |
      This is DNA sequence showing where the barcode is on the transposon used for mutagenesis, along with some flanking sequence.
  input_minN :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum number of reads
    short-hint : |
      Minimum number of reads for a mutant to be picked for the pool
    long-hint  : |
      This is the minimum number of barcode reads required for a mutant to be picked for the TnSeq pool.  The default is 5, but larger numbers are OK.
  output_mapped_reads :
    ui-name : |
      Output mapped reads
    short-hint : |
      MappedReads object created by this method
    long-hint  : |
      This method will create a MappedReads object indicating where all the barcode insertions map to in your genome.
  output_pool :
    ui-name : |
      Output Pool
    short-hint : |
      Pool object created by this method
    long-hint  : |
      This method will create a Pool (i.e, TnSeq library) object that includes the starting counts for all barcoded mutant strains in the TnSeq experiment.
